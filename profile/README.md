# KeepSimple and UX Core
## We make complex things comprehensible, and comprehensible things achievable.

KeepSimple was founded in 2019 by Wolf Alexanyan as a free, public initiative exploring the intersection of management, IT, and cognitive science. Since then, it has grown into a recognized open-source hub for practical frameworks, educational tools, and experiments in applied behavioral science.

Today, KeepSimple hosts several major modules, including:

## Contribute UX Core

A first-of-its-kind free educational tool, UX Core quickly spread through global product management communities after its release in 2020.

Contains 1,000+ practical examples of cognitive biases applied to product design, software development, and team management.

Widely recognized by leading scholars in cognitive science and behavioral economics (Duke University, Harvard Business School, AUD, and others).

Actively used by managers, designers, and educators worldwide.

## Company Management

A modular management framework built for remote-first software development companies. Originally designed for Wolf's own startup - The Software Development Company - it became the first public attempt in the region to open-source its internal structure and processes at this level of detail.

## What’s Next

KeepSimple continues to evolve:
- New articles on project and product management.
- A backlog of AI-powered tools under active development.
- Ongoing improvements to make complex organizational science accessible, practical, and collaborative.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers, product managers, researchers, and anyone passionate about making knowledge more actionable. Whether it’s code, content, or ideas—your input helps KeepSimple grow.
